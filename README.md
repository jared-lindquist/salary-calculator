## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The problem presented by the client was that they were unable to calculate total labor cost vs their monthly budget of $20,000.

This problem was solved by creating an application to calculate salaries and determine a labor budget for a business. This gives the user immediate visualization over their employees, titles, and annual salary information. Once all the input fields are filled in and submitted, it gathers the data into a dynamic table with all the information for each employee in a row. 

Once employees are entered into the table, the app then calculates labor cost against a total monthly budget of $20,000, by combining all submitted employee salaries and dividing the number by 12. If the total monthly budget goes over $20,000, the budget field will turn red, notifying the user that they have gone over budget.

The application also allows the user to remove any added employee, giving the user a way to visualize different combinations of employee salaries against the monthly budget.
